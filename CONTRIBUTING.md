#Guidelines for contributors:  
1) When making a PR, make sure it's based on the develop branch.  
2) Make sure your PR from branch is not develop or master. It'll make things 100% easier to manage later on.  
    ``` git checkout -b <branch name here> ``` is a useful command for this while on develop branch.

###More will be added later on.
